# Chaos_game
An interactive application to create fractals and play with them.
This project was born to create images for a document about the chaos game.

## Getting started
The program is  tested with Python 3.9.
It requires the libraries pygame and numpy.
To start the program just execute the main.py file.

## Usage
To create your first fractal just place some points by clicking with the mouse and press 'SPACE'. Press 'SPACE' again to do draw more points.
To create a regular poligon use the numeric keyboard or the ➕➖ buttons in the setting window.
You can interact with the object in different ways:
- Drag the vertices
- Add a vertex by clicking with the mouse
- Change the parameter alpha by pressing the keys 'N' or 'M'
- Change the way in which the sequence of points is constructed by selecting some circles in the "circle of circles" you find in the setting window
- From the setting window you can also change the colors of the fractals and use some presets (with the button 'S' you can add a new preset)
- Clicking 'B' you pass from night_mode to day_mode and viceversa

You can find the explanation of how the sequence of points is generated in
