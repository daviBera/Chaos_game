# Chaos_game
An interactive application to create fractals and play with them.
This project was born to create images for a document about the chaos game.

## Getting started
Download and extract the zip file.
The program is  tested with Python 3.9. and requires the libraries pygame and numpy.
To start the app just execute the [main.py](https://github.com/daviBera/Chaos_game/blob/main/main.py) file.

## Usage
To create your first fractal just place some vertecis by clicking with the mouse and press 'SPACE'. Press 'SPACE' again to do draw more points of the fractal.
To create a regular poligon use the numeric keyboard or the ➕➖ buttons in the setting window.
You can interact with the object in different ways:
- Drag the vertices
- Add a vertex by clicking with the mouse
- Change the parameter alpha by pressing the keys 'N' or 'M'
- Zoom in and out by pressing the keys 'Q' and 'E' and traslate by pressing 'A', 'D, 'W', 'S'.
- Change the way in which the sequence of points is constructed by selecting some circles in the "circle of circles" you find in the setting window
- From the setting window you can also change the colors of the fractals and use some presets (with the button 'S' you can add a new preset)
- Change the background from night_mode to day_mode and viceversa by pressing 'B'

You can find the explanation of how the fractal is generated in [explanation.md](https://github.com/daviBera/Chaos_game/blob/main/expalnation.md)
